_This is the fourth of many weekly progress reports that I will be publishing for the duration of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ_.

This week:

- Last week, I mentioned that I was working on the cookbook chapter.
  I opened a GitHub issue for it [here](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/329). I moved documentation about deck cloning that I found in [this article](https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/new-in-2-3-deck-cloning/20267) to a new chapter of the manual that I called the cookbook.
  I opened a [pull request for it here](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/pull/330) .
  I still have a couple of requested changes to make on it before it can get merged. I’m thinking that will be this week.
- I also mentioned in my previous blog post that I would be moving all my blog posts about my internship experience with Outreachy to the Mixxx website repository.
  I did that too. I opened a [pull request](https://github.com/mixxxdj/website/pull/177) for that here. Just like the first, I still have a lot of changes to make (as requested) before it can get merged. I’m happy that I get to contribute to not just the Mixxx manual, but the website as well.☺
- Christmas day was on Friday. So I took some time off to spend with family from the 25th – 27th.
    I didn’t do a lot of work on these two and half days.
- This week, I plan to finish up on the above two pull requests.
  And then move onto moving the chapter “[DJing with Mixxx](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html)” to the cookbook.I planned to do this last week, but I didn’t get around to doing so.. This task will be moved to this week.
- I also plan to get/ create more content that I can add to the cookbook chapter…
- …and then pick an open [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues) that I can work on this week.
- I am not making Mixxx video tutorials as often as I hoped to.
    I think it’s because I am spending more time improving the Mixxx manual and contributing to the website repo – which is also okay. But this week, I should try to deliver on those promises that I made about making better _Getting Started_ videos.
