  <H2>About Mixxx</H2>

  <p>
    Mixxx was originally created in 2002 as part of a PhD thesis on new
    interfaces for DJing by Tue Haste Andersen.  After releasing the project as
    open source, dozens of contributors began modifying and improving Mixxx.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2006, a new development team lead by Adam Davison and Albert Santoni
    began reorganizing the project to ensure smooth growth of both the codebase
    and the number of contributors. A renewed focus on usability and stability
    has helped Mixxx grow to become the most popular free DJ software in the
    world, receiving <b>over 1,000,000 downloads annually</b>. Our committed
    team has worked hard to create great DJ software, and this growth is a sign
    of our success.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2011, RJ Ryan took over as Lead Developer to successfully continue the
    team's endeavor to make Mixxx a world-class DJ software.
  </p>

  <p>
    As our user community grows, so does our development team - As of Mixxx
    1.11.0, <b>over 100 developers and artists</b> have helped create Mixxx!
  </p>

  <p>
    Mixxx also participated in
    <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> in 2007,
    2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Google Summer of Code is a program that
    provides college students with a stipend over the summer to work on open
    source projects. Mentors from Mixxx introduced students to open source
    software development and helped them gain experience working with
    multithreaded, real-time multimedia software.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    Mixxx started as an open source project because of demand for DJing software
    on Linux, and discontent with proprietary DJ software on Windows and Mac OS
    X. Today, Mixxx development is driven by the simple idea that together we
    can create a better way to DJ, and that has brought Mixxx to the cutting
    edge. Mixxx is the only free cross-platform vinyl control software and has
    the most advanced MIDI controller support via our innovative
    Javascript-based MIDI scripting engine. We are continuing to pursue new and
    exciting features that give DJs more tools to create better live mixes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides scratching our own itches, many people work on Mixxx as a way to
    learn about audio programming, or even just because it's fun and they enjoy
    programming. The creative aspect of Mixxx attracts developers with a broad
    range of skills and talents, and that makes for a fun development team that
    helps Mixxx continue to grow.
