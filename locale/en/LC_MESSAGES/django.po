"Mixxx was originally created in 2002 as part of a PhD thesis on new "

"open source, dozens of contributors began modifying and improving Mixxx."
msgstr ""

#: pages/press.html:17
msgid ""
"In 2006, a new development team lead by Adam Davison and Albert Santoni "
"began reorganizing the project to ensure smooth growth of both the codebase "
"and the number of contributors. A renewed focus on usability and stability "
"has helped Mixxx grow to become the most popular free DJ software in the "
"world, receiving <b>over 1,000,000 downloads annually</b>. Our committed "

msgstr ""

#: pages/press.html:35
msgid ""
"Mixxx started as an open source project because of demand for DJing software "

"X. Today, Mixxx development is driven by the simple idea that together we "
"can create a better way to DJ, and that has brought Mixxx to the cutting "
"edge. Mixxx is the only free cross-platform vinyl control software and has "
"the most advanced MIDI controller support via our innovative Javascript-"

"features that give DJs more tools to create better live mixes."

"Besides scratching our own itches, many people work on Mixxx as a way to "
