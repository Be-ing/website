## A little bit about me.

My name is Deborah Aanyu from Uganda. I am 23 years old. I come from a family of five children – I am the eldest. I have been in Catholic (single sex) school for most of my education, and it was during this time that I got to appreciate the beauty of God in the world, and in my life. I was in mixed school for only two years, up until University. As an adventurous person, I like to try out a lot of things; from art and painting, to singing, writing, sports (basketball), web development, among other things.

I am generally optimistic and believe the good in people. I like to read and write. I like to dream, talk, listen and see the sunrise in the morning. I like to see the moonlight at night and feel the rain on my face. I like flowers. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. I like warm clothes and a nice cup of tea. I also love babies, nature and laughter. I love food and listening to music.

I have been studying a Computer Engineering degree at Makerere University, Kampala for the last four years, and I finished my final examinations just recently. So I’ve been really excited about getting done with school and  having the time to focus on what I really want to do which is software development and contributing to Open source!!

I will be working on improving Mixxx DJ’s user manual for the Outreachy Internship. Mixxx DJ is an Open Source application for DJs that gives them the power to mix songs for free. Each day that I wake up, I am so grateful for the opportunities that I am given, and looking at how I got here, I can’t help but feel enthusiastic for the journey ahead, bumps and all! I’m here for all of it.

I would love to travel and see the world someday, meet new people and make new friendships. There are many things that I would love to do, see, and experience. I am also working towards attaining seniority level with web development (particularly with JavaScript) and just the MERN stack in general. (Let’s give it one more year) I aspire to be successful at everything that I do so that I can share my journey and use my experience to inspire other people, especially women. I am passionate about women empowerment and would love to see more women leaders in the technology sector.


## My top three core values

### Honesty. Respect. Adventure

#### Honesty

As a young teen, I was very shy – bordering on fearful. I feared everybody including my own parents. I feared to do the wrong thing because I wanted to be in everybody’s good books. I needed the approval of my friends, family and everybody who cared about me. Because of this, I was telling lies all the time. I was turning into a diabolical liar! I didn’t even lie because I had anything to hide. I lied so that I could tell only the best version of events. I lied to avoid attracting too much attention to myself. I lied to make people happy. I lied because I was fearful of the consequences, even if my actions were not wrong.

Eventually, I got caught. I saw how my lies were affecting the people around me and my father asked, “why do you lie so much?” and I had no real reason, except for my low self esteem. So it wouldn’t be enough to just stop lying (if it was that easy), but I had to work on my self-image, how I felt about about myself in relation to the people around me. One of the hardest things I had to practice at the time, was telling the [hard] truth, however terrible I thought it was. I discovered that people would rather be told the harsh, disappointing, heart-wrenching (lol) truth, than be deceived with words you think they would rather hear. I found that I would rather deal with the immediate, but brief disappointment that comes with telling the truth, as opposed to the hurtful or pained expressions on their faces when they found out about the lie. I practiced this everyday, even though some days were harder than others, but it got easy. Eventually, the truth became the easier, most obvious option. I didn’t have to think twice about it anymore and concoct stories. A huge burden is lifted off my shoulders every time I tell the truth in a difficult situation, because I know it would probably be easier to lie. I did not lie, and the world didn’t cave in.

It is because of this phase in my life that I appreciate honesty so much more. I appreciate it more because I know sometimes the truth can be very difficult, and it is not always easy to say. I appreciate honesty because it comes with no burden, and it leaves you free from guilt – of hurting others or causing even more damage. I value honesty because I have seen first hand how badly it can affect relationships with loved ones, how it can end a marriage and a life long friendship. Honesty is a core value for me because it has saved me from a lot of things and I can only imagine how my life would have been if I had been transparent from the start.

#### Respect
