### Realizing a More Diverse Community

Mixxx is proud to announce that we have been officially accepted into the Outreachy program and are immediately [raising funds](https://opencollective.com/mixxx) to sponsor our first Intern for the December 2020 cycle!
We first announced our intention to join with Outreachy back in [June](../2020-06-29-black-lives-matter), and we're excited that our plan is coming to fruition.

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides three-month internships to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science.
Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.

Outreacy expressly invites women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply.
We also expressly invite applications from residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.
Anyone who faces under-representation, systematic bias, or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.

More details and eligibility criteria can be found on the [Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/)

[**Applications are opening soon!**](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/)

### Internship Funding

Because Mixxx is an all-volunteer community, we don't yet have the funds we need to sponsor our first intern.

That's where you come in!

Our users have told us they want to give back, even though Mixxx is and always will be free.
This is your chance to show your love for Mixxx.
We've set up a fundraiser on OpenCollective so you can help Mixxx expand its contributor base and become a more vibrant, sustainable project.
You can make a one-time donation, or you can set up a monthly contribution too.
Our first goal is to sponsor our new Intern, and if we raise more than we need, we'll try to sponsor more than one.
