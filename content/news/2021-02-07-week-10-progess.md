_This is the tenth weekly progress report of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ._

This week:

- I made the required edits to the YouTube tutorial about the Mixxx  communities and uploaded it to YouTube.
 Here is the link. [Get in touch with the Mixxx community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6QrjiFNJQ)
- I had a brief video call with community team leaders from the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) to discuss more about the [internet censorship situation](https://explorer.ooni.org/country/UG) that has been going on in Uganda.
 The purpose of the discussion was to understand more about how I am using Tor and other anti-censorship tools, and how it can be improved based on my feedback.
- As part of the homework that I did for the cookbook chapter, I read through the first few chapters of the Mixxx manual, looking for sections that could use the step by step instruction approach that the cookbook will provide.
 I found an area in the ‚Äú[Analyze your tracks/ library](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.2/en/chapters/library.html#analyze-prepare-your-tracks)‚Äù section that needed more explanation, and discussed it in the Zulip chat.
 I will be filing an issue and making a pull request for it soon.
- I lost a day of work to no electricity and maybe half a day to the poor internet speeds (some of the downsides to using VPNs).
- Next week, I will be working on a number of pull requests implementing suggested changes. One of them includes converting the deck cloning section into a step by step instruction guide as opposed to a whole article.
- I will be adding new sections to the same chapter with the same step by step approach ‚Äì this will be my main task this week. All the (new) sections that I will be adding are subject to discussion. It is a work in progress üôÇ
- Finally, I will be making another YouTube tutorial introducing Mixxx to the first time user‚Ä¶ This tutorial will be guided by [chapter 4 of the manual](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.2/en/chapters/library.html) and will go something like;

`Start the Mixxx software
- Import music to the Mixxx library - import your audio files
- Analyze your library tracks (what it means to analyze a track)
- Configure Sound output - especially if youre not using any DJ Hardware
- Play your first track with Mixxx
- The Mixxx manual - incase you need to refer to a Mixxx resource for help`
