_This is the third of many weekly progress reports that I will be publishing for the duration of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ_.

This week:

- I made a [pull request #327](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/pull/327) in response to [this issue](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/289) .
  I  moved the standard effects mapping documentation to section 11.5 of the manual.
- Currently working on the cookbook chapter.
  I am moving documentation about deck cloning that I found in [this article]({filename}/news/new-in-2-3-deck-cloning.md) to a new chapter of the manual that I am calling the cookbook.
  I will then move onto moving the chapter ‚Äú[DJing with Mixxx](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html)‚Äù to the cookbook as well.
- This week, I plan to move all my blog posts about my internship with Outreachy to the Mixxx website repository, and then if time allows,
  I will record another video tutorial about Mixxx DJ.
- I also plan to work on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/320.)
  and make a PR for it this week.
- I lost a couple of days to non-Mixxx related tasks.
  I had a slack week in general, in between finishing with University, submitting my project, moving out of my room, and then travelling home for the holidays ‚Äì among other things. Because of this, I was not able to achieve all that I had planned to do this week. (see [Week 2 ‚Äì progress report]({filename/news/2020-12-14-week-2-progress.md})). However, I do plan make up for it this week, and at the end of the (official) internship period.üòâ
