_This is the ninth weekly progress report of my Outreachy internship with Mixxx DJ._

This week:

- I made a pull request [#203](https://github.com/mixxxdj/website/pull/203) for this [issue](https://github.com/mixxxdj/website/issues/200) that I had filed to correct the broken link to Paul Bloch of open Artist (creator of the Mixxx logo).
- I recorded the video tutorial about the Mixxx communities, following the script that I wrote the week before last.
 I got feedback for it from my mentor, and I need to do some editing.
 I will be editing and uploading this video next week, after getting feedback from the community on [Zulip](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/109176-documentation/topic/How.20to.20videos.20on.20YouTube).
- Following the discussion on GitHub for [issue 335](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/issues/335), I have rearranged the [Live Broadcasting â€“ Start your own Internet radio chapter](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.2/en/chapters/livebroadcasting.html) â€“ mostly just headings.
 I made a pull request for it [here](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/pull/346).
- Next week, I will be writing a script for the next video tutorial that I will be making (yet to decide which one but most likely it will be a 5-minute in-depth video about mixing (once the program is set up).
 I have homework to do with this one, considering the fact that Iâ€™m not a pro with mixing, but I look forward to the challenge.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
- Once I have done my homework and written the script, I will record the video, send the first cut to my mentor for feedback before I re-record or edit the final video.
 Just like I did for the Mixxx communities video.
- I also realise that I need to do my homework on the cookbook. (See [comment](https://github.com/mixxxdj/manual/pull/330#issuecomment-753349988) on cookbook chapter).
 I need to choose topics that will not conflict with the [DJing with Mixxx chapter](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.2/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html).
 Some of the topics that I had chosen earlier were similarâ€¦. with the content in this chapter. This will be my assignment this week.
